# Eliminate-Old-Word
Shakespeare's plays traditionally have many words that are now either out of use or spelled differently. Write a program that displays the 25 most frequently used words in Othello that are not in the corpus of the modern English words (the NLTK words).

Your program shall download the file with urllib, extract the text with BeautifulSoup, tokenize the text with NLTK, and count the words that are not in the words corpus.
